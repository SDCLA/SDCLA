- 👋 Hi, I’m @SDCLA
- 👀 I’m a researcher mainly working on Greek rhetorical style in the Second Sophistic. 
- 🌱 I’m currently working with various computational tools for the analysis of Greek and Latin texts, and getting enough of a grasp of Python for that! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to work on anything in that area
- 📫 How to reach me: Here or my email samdo217@liverpool.ac.uk
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ I'm really a philologist who occasionally codes, rather than a coder who does philology, so bear with me!
